# Bootstrap-and-Permutation-Test
This is a project I did in the Spring of 2017 for the graduate course, Statistical Computing. This project used the data set Cars93 from the library, UsingR. 
In this project, I used a bootstrap approach to obtain a 90% confidence interval for an estimate of the coefficient of variation of the variable, EngineSize. I also used a permutation test to see whether the coefficient of variation of EngineSize is different dependent on the origin of the car.
